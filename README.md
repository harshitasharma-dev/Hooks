# Hooks


Hooks = This is a new concept came up in React latest version 16.8

The main concept behind bringing HOOKS into picture is to use the React features without creating a class.

In this repository, I have created a very basic example demonstrating the way to use one of the hooks from React Hooks as "useState"

CLONING :
  You can clone this repository by using command "git clone "repository_url" ", in GIT BASH
  After that you can install all the node modules using "npm install --save" or "npm i"
  Later you can run the project by using "npm start".
